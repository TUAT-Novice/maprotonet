# MAProtoNet
Welcome to the official implementation of MAProtoNet (Multi-scale Attentive Prototypical Network).

MAProtoNet is an interpretable 3D MRI model for brain tumor, training on the public BraTS datasets. We extend the XProtoNet and MProtoNet by introducing the novel 
<!-- quadruplet attention layers -->
as well as the 
<!-- multi-scale module. -->
